# StreetMicrogrid

This a playground for learning and applying course material to an area of interest to me.  The idea is to investigate what it takes to make a street energy independent.  

1) 169 houses of smart meter data (publicly available from London Power Networks kaggle data)
2) London Stanstead EnergyPlus weather file (hourly weather data) - other climate change weather files available or look to an open API e.g. WeatherUnderground for historical data
3) Initially simple solar PV model

4) Wind turbine model
5) Energy trading - blockchain
6) Replace smart meter data with markov chain model of energy demand usage
7) Demand shifting
